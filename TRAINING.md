# Training the Sigil Hard Mode AI

This guide explains how to train the AlphaZero-style AI that powers hard mode
in single-player Sigil. The system uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) guided
by a 2.17M-parameter neural network (SigilNet) trained via self-play.

## Hardware Requirements

### Minimum (CPU-only)
- 4+ CPU cores
- 8 GB RAM
- 10 GB disk space
- Expect ~1 self-play game per minute, ~3 days for one training iteration

### Recommended (GPU)
- NVIDIA GPU with 4+ GB VRAM (RTX 3060 or better)
- 8+ CPU cores (self-play is CPU-bound; more cores = more parallelism)
- 16 GB RAM
- 20 GB disk space
- Expect ~10 self-play games per minute on GPU, ~1 day per iteration

Self-play is the bottleneck. The MCTS game tree search runs on CPU (SimBoard
is pure Python), while the neural network evaluations benefit from GPU. Most
training time is spent generating games, not running gradient descent.

## Setup

```bash
# Install PyTorch (pick one)
pip install torch                                          # GPU (CUDA auto-detected)
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu  # CPU-only

# Verify
python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__, torch.cuda.is_available())"
```

No other dependencies are needed beyond NumPy (included with PyTorch).

## Quick Start

Run these commands from the project root directory.

```bash
# Step 1: Generate self-play training data (start small to verify it works)
python -m ai.selfplay_mcts --games 100 --sims 400

# Step 2: Train the network
python -m ai.train_sigil --data ai/data/*.jsonl --epochs 10 --device cuda

# Step 3: Test the trained model against the previous best
python -m ai.arena --model1 ai/models/best_model.pt --games 100 --sims 200
```

## Full Training Loop

The AI improves through repeated cycles of self-play and training. Each
iteration generates new games using the current best model, trains a new
model on the accumulated data, then tests whether the new model is stronger.

### Step 1: Generate Self-Play Data

```bash
python -m ai.selfplay_mcts \
  --games 10000 \
  --sims 400 \
  --model ai/models/best_model.pt \
  --output ai/data/selfplay_gen01.jsonl
```

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--games` | Number of games to play | 100 |
| `--sims` | MCTS simulations per move (more = stronger play, slower) | 400 |
| `--model` | Model checkpoint to use (omit for random/new model) | None |
| `--output` | Output file path | `ai/data/selfplay_<timestamp>.jsonl` |

Each game produces ~20-50 training positions. 10,000 games yields ~300K
positions, enough for a meaningful training iteration.

**Tip:** You can run multiple self-play processes in parallel on different
CPU cores, each writing to a different output file. The training step can
read multiple files.

### Step 2: Train the Network

```bash
python -m ai.train_sigil \
  --data ai/data/selfplay_gen01.jsonl ai/data/selfplay_gen02.jsonl \
  --model ai/models/best_model.pt \
  --output ai/models/candidate_gen02.pt \
  --epochs 10 \
  --batch-size 512 \
  --lr 0.001 \
  --device cuda
```

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--data` | One or more JSONL data files | (required) |
| `--model` | Existing model to continue training | None (new model) |
| `--output` | Where to save the trained model | `ai/models/best_model.pt` |
| `--epochs` | Training epochs over the data | 10 |
| `--batch-size` | Batch size | 512 |
| `--lr` | Initial learning rate | 0.001 |
| `--max-records` | Max positions to load (rolling window) | 500,000 |
| `--device` | `cpu` or `cuda` | cpu |

The training loop reports per-epoch loss (value + policy), validation loss,
and value prediction accuracy. You should see:

- **Value loss** decreasing over epochs (MSE between predicted and actual outcome)
- **Policy loss** decreasing (cross-entropy between network policy and MCTS visit counts)
- **Value accuracy** increasing (did the network predict the right winner?)

### Step 3: Gate the New Model

Before accepting a newly trained model, test it against the current best:

```bash
python -m ai.arena \
  --model1 ai/models/candidate_gen02.pt \
  --model2 ai/models/best_model.pt \
  --games 400 \
  --sims 200
```

The candidate must win at least 55% of games to be accepted. If accepted,
copy it to `best_model.pt`:

```bash
cp ai/models/candidate_gen02.pt ai/models/best_model.pt
```

### Step 4: Repeat

Go back to Step 1 using the new best model. Each iteration should produce
a stronger AI. A typical training schedule:

| Iteration | Games | Cumulative Positions | Expected Strength |
|-----------|-------|---------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | 10,000 | ~300K | Beats random play consistently |
| 2 | 10,000 | ~600K | Beats heuristic AI |
| 3-5 | 10,000 each | ~1.5M | Beats old NN+alpha-beta AI |
| 5-10 | 10,000 each | ~3M | Competitive with strong humans |

## Deploying a Trained Model

### Option A: PyTorch (if PyTorch is installed on the server)

Just place the `.pt` file at `ai/models/best_model.pt`. The game server
loads it automatically when a hard-mode game starts.

### Option B: NumPy export (no PyTorch on server)

Export the trained model to a pure-NumPy format:

```bash
python -m ai.export_numpy \
  --model ai/models/best_model.pt \
  --output ai/models/best_model_numpy.json
```

This produces a JSON file (~46 MB) that can run inference using only NumPy.
To use it, update `ai/mcts_ai_player.py` to load the NumPy model instead.

## Tuning Tips

- **More simulations = stronger but slower.** 400 sims for training, 800 for
  production play is a good balance. Increase to 1600+ for maximum strength
  at the cost of longer think times.

- **Learning rate.** Start at 0.001, the cosine scheduler drops it to 0.0001
  over the training epochs. If training is unstable (loss spikes), try 0.0005.

- **Data quality matters more than quantity.** Games played with more MCTS
  simulations produce better training signal. 1,000 games at 800 sims can
  be more valuable than 10,000 games at 50 sims.

- **Keep old data.** The training script accepts multiple data files. Include
  data from earlier generations (up to the 500K position window) so the
  network doesn't forget what it learned.

- **First iteration bootstrap.** The very first training run starts from a
  random network, so the self-play games will be low quality. This is normal.
  Quality improves rapidly after the first training cycle.

## Git Branch Strategy

Training data and model weights are managed across two branches:

- **`main`** — Production code and the latest/best model checkpoint
  (`ai/models/best_model.pt`). Training data files (`training_data/`,
  `training_data_v2/`, `ai/data/`) should NOT be committed here. Only
  update `best_model.pt` on main when a new model passes gating.

- **`training-data`** — All self-play training data (JSONL files, SGN game
  transcripts). This branch tracks main and adds the data on top. Use it
  for development and training runs.

When you produce a new trained model:

```bash
# On training-data branch: commit new self-play data
git checkout training-data
git add ai/data/selfplay_gen03.jsonl
git commit -m "Add gen03 self-play data (10K games)"

# After gating passes: update best model on main
git checkout main
cp ai/models/candidate_gen03.pt ai/models/best_model.pt
git add ai/models/best_model.pt
git commit -m "Update best model to gen03"
```

This keeps the main branch lightweight (the model checkpoint is ~9 MB)
while preserving the full training history on the data branch.
